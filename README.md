# Hi There 
## Chandrasekhar Reddy Peechari
### AI Platform Engineer | DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure

I design and build scalable AI platforms and cloud infrastructure that are reliable, secure, and production-ready.

My work sits at the intersection of AI systems, DevOps automation, and distributed cloud architecture. I focus on enabling engineering teams to deploy faster, operate safely, and scale intelligently.

## About Me

I am an AI Platform Engineer with a strong foundation in DevOps, cloud-native systems, and infrastructure automation.

I specialize in:

- Building cloud-native AI/ML platforms  
- Designing Infrastructure as Code architectures  
- Implementing secure and automated CI/CD pipelines  
- Improving observability and reliability in production systems  
- Creating reusable platform foundations for engineering teams  

I approach engineering with a systems mindset — every component should be scalable, observable, secure, and automated.

## Engineering Philosophy

Good engineering is:

- Automated  
- Observable  
- Secure  
- Scalable  
- Simple  

I believe infrastructure should be treated as software.  
Pipelines should enforce security by default.  
Platforms should empower developers — not slow them down.

## Current Focus

- Designing AI-ready cloud infrastructure patterns  
- Building reusable Terraform modules for scalable environments  
- Strengthening DevSecOps integration in CI/CD pipelines  
- Deepening expertise in distributed systems for AI workloads  
- Developing production-grade AI platform architectures
